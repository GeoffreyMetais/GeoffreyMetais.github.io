VLC 3.2 is the second feature update for VLC 3. This update focused on polishing the user interface, adding some more features to Android TV and chromebooks and improving network browsing.

Under the hood, the VLC app is now (almost) 100% written in kotlin!

## UI redesign, including player and TV browsers

### Android TV

The browsing on Android TV has been made easier and more efficient.

You can now browse your media, filter them, jump to headers in a brand new screen.

    <source src="/assets/images/v3.2/tv_browser_animation.mp4" type="video/mp4">
  </video>
</figure>

When listening music, a `Now playing` line now displays media currently played

### Players

On phones and tablets, the video player interface has been modernized and the controls have been reorganized.

### Chromebook

We added the support for desktop multi-selection with ctrl and shift. We also implemented most of the VLC desktop player keyboard shortcuts.

The support for external devices has also been improved.

## Group videos by name feature

The videos can be grouped by name or by folder allowing you to find the right video quicker.
This implementation is quite basic right now, next feature update will improve it to have grid view for any king of videos grouping.

## Voice search on TV

The Medialibrary content is now searchable from TV launcher.

## Cleaner media titles

The media titles are cleaned up for a better readability. Medialibrary now removes files extension and common garbage keywords from video files title.

## Improved SMBv2/3 support

The SMB support has been improved to provide a better network browsing experience.
There should be no conflict between SMBv1 and v2/v3 anymore.
And login process has been improved too.

## Under the hood

LibVLC has been updated, to get latest fixes, security patches and performance enhancements.

The whole Android app is now 100% written in kotlin! (but the medialibrary and libvlc API bindings remain in Java, to not induce kotlin dependency)

We also improved the architecture by continuing our Android Arch components integration and by the use of kotlin coroutines.
