## STOP playback service
There are 2 ways to completely stop vlc player service (and not just pause playback), but this action has no explicit button.
- **With mini player**: long press on play/pause button

- **With playback icon**: **only when playback is paused**
  - on Android 5+: you can swipe the notification.
  - on Android 4.x: you should have a 'x' button on top-right corner.

## Repeat video
With version 2.1 you'll have the repeat button available in the video player advanced options, but you can already do that with version 2.0.x:  
**Long press on play/pause** button to switch playback to *repeat* mode so your video playback will loop

## Reorder media in current playlist
Simply **drag** media within current playlist to reorder it.

## Load last playlist
In action bar, the circled *play* button triggers loading of last playlist from the current category: In video view it will load last video(s) played, in Audio view it will load last audio playlist.

With remote play/pause control (wired headset or bluetooth ad2p device) when VLC is not playing, you can load last audio playlist and continue playback where you stopped it.

## Next/previous by swipe
**Swipe miniplayer** on left/right triggers skip to previous/next media.
