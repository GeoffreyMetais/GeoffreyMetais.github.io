{% include toc icon="thumbs-o-up" title="Tips" %}

## Play video on your Chromecast

VLC does not yet support Chromecast, but you already can use it!

Android can cast its screen content and audio to it.
Here are some ways to access this option:
 - With the [quick toggle](/assets/images/tips/shortcut_cast.png)
 - In [Display settings](/assets/images/tips/settings_cast.png)
 - In Google Home [app menu](/assets/images/tips/home_cast.png)  
     You can [find Google Home here](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.apps.chromecast.app)

VLC detects the secondary display (your Chromecast) like it does if you plug your device to your TV with a HDMI cable, and video player will show you this screen:

You have normal controls like swipe to seek and go to advanced options while you watch your movie on TV üì∫ üòÉ

## STOP playback service
There are 2 ways to completely stop vlc player service (and not just pause playback), but this action has no explicit button.
- **With mini player**: long press on play/pause button
![stop player](/assets/images/tips/stop.gif)
- **With playback icon**: **only when playback is paused**
  - on Android 5+: you can swipe the notification.
  - on Android 4.x: you should have a 'x' button on top-right corner.

## Repeat video
With version 2.1 you'll have the repeat button available in the video player advanced options, but you can already do that with version 2.0.x:  
**Long press on play/pause** button to switch playback to *repeat* mode so your video playback will loop

## Reorder media in current playlist
Simply **drag** media within current playlist to reorder it.

## Load last playlist
In action bar, the circled *play* button triggers loading of last playlist from the current category: In video view it will load last video(s) played, in Audio view it will load last audio playlist.

With remote play/pause control (wired headset or bluetooth ad2p device) when VLC is not playing, you can load last audio playlist and continue playback where you stopped it.

## Next/previous by swipe
**Swipe miniplayer** on left/right triggers skip to previous/next media.
