This is the first feature update in the VLC 3 cycle.
<!--summary-->
This version only supports Android 4.2 and newer. This allows to use up-to-date SDK and restore some features like Android Auto!

# Onboarding

Scanning your whole device storage is no longer mandatory. We have the will to keep VLC application lightweigt, and some of you only use it as a player.  
We heard that, and now you can choose between the classic big scanning, a folder selection or no medialibrary at all!  
VLC still provides a file and network browser, if that's enough for you.

# Launcher shortcuts

On Android 7.1+, you can resume the last playlist you were listening to without even opening VLC  ðŸ˜Œ  
Just long press on VLC icon on your device and shortcuts will pop up.

They are only static shortcuts for now, we plan to make it customizable.
